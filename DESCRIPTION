Description: HyDDG provides a suite of tools to detect differentially expressed genes 
    (DEGs) using a hypergeometric distribution-based approach. This package allows users 
    to compute fold changes, perform statistical tests for up- and down-regulated genes, 
    and adjust p-values for multiple testing. The core functionality includes calculating 
    statistical significance for each gene based on experimental and control group data, 
    and outputs meaningful DEGs with recommended thresholds for fold change and FDR. 
    It is specifically designed for transcriptomics data analysis, making it ideal for 
    researchers working in bioinformatics and computational biology.
